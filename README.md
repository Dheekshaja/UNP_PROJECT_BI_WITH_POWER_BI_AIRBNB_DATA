# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_AIRBNB_DATA

During my internship at United Network of Professionals, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze Airbnb dataset.  This involved data preparation, including removing unnecessary columns, correcting data types, and created measures using DAX between key metrics like revenue, availability, average price, and total listings.  The dashboard tracks KPIs such as total listings, total revenue, average price, total reviews, and availability, enabling data-driven decision-making.  It also provides insights into pricing trends, seasonality, and host performance. This project enhanced my data cleaning, business intelligence, and Power BI visualization skills, and improved my ability to analyze market trends.  The project files have been submitted for further development and reference.
